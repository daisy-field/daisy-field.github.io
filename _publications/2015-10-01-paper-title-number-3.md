Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection in Intelligent Transportation Systems"

excerpt: 'The increasing digitalization of the transporta-
tion sector alongside other safety-critical infrastructures is
accompanied by the challenge of an increasing number
of cyberattacks, which cause not only financial losses and
reputational damage but also put human lives at risk.
However, many machine learning methods used to automate
the detection of intrusions suffer from the absence of much
needed labelled or, when employing unsupervised anomaly-
based approaches, large diverse sets of benign training data.
In addition, required data is often highly heterogeneous and
distributed across the transportation systems. To overcome
these challenges, we propose an intrusion detection system
combined with federated learning for intelligent transporta-
tion systems as a stepping stone towards a framework
applicable in real-world conditions, to enable any number
of distributed nodes on the roadside as well as connected
autonomous vehicles to construct detection models collab-
oratively and to continuously adapt them over their entire
life cycle. In initial experiments, the framework is evaluated
with an exemplary configuration and on datasets collected
from our smart city test field along with the CIC-IDS2017
dataset. The results show, that it effectively detects all of the
abnormal events within milliseconds while outperforming the
non-federated approach by more than 20%.'
